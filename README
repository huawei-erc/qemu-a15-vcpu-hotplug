VCPU Hotplug, (c) 2012-2013 Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmBH

The branch "vcpu-hp-ioctl-change" has linux headers which are compatible
with the change in the KVM ARM ioctl API
KVM_SET_DEVICE_ADDRESS -> KVM_ARM_SET_DEVICE_ADDR.

If you use a kernel which uses the KVM_SET_DEVICE_ADDRESS name instead,
use the branch "vcpu-hp".

The kernel version available here uses KVM_ARM_SET_DEVICE_ADDR, so
the suggestion is to use the default "vcpu-hp-ioctl-change" branch.

More detailed information about how to set up the full VCPU Hotplug feat
will be available as soon as the kernel branch is also pushed.
